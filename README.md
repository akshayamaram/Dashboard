      to add category section and uncheck from category list

# React + Vite
    - This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
    - Currently, two official plugins are available:
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
